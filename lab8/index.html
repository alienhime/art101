		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>In this lab, Maya and I learned how to use anonymous functions and callbacks in JavaScript.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>It was a bit difficult getting accustomed to the new syntax associated with these operations, but otherwise we didn't experience any issues that hindered our progress.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You're looking at the index.html file I created! To see the results of my program, open your JavaScript console.</p>
