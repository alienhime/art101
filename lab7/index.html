		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>In this lab, my partner and I were tasked with writing a JavaScript program that takes the user's name and input and returns a sorted version.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Fortunately, we didn't encounter any major issues while working on this lab.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You're looking at the index.html file I created! You should have been greeted with a window pop-up after opening this page that prompted you to enter your name. My program has been kind enough to make some modifications, which can be viewed below:</p>

      <h2>Script Output</h2>
