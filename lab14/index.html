		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Our task for this lab was to go back through our old labs and debug them.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We had a really tough time figuring out what was wrong with my partner's code because the console wasn't returning any errors, but we were eventually able to figure out by comparing differences in our code since mine was functional.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You're looking at the webpage I created! You can see the results of our debugging efforts in the section below.</p>
